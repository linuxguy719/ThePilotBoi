 Hi, I’m @ThePilotBoi! I’m interested in Linux, fire/security alarms, ham radio, cars and airplanes!
     I'm pretty new to programming and I'm not the worlds best contributer lol
     I have two usernames that I go by and I am in the process of changing everthing over to linuxguy719 to have some continuity
     I love cats, rabbits, dogs and other cute animals.
